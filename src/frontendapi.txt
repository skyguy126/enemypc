When user enters /home, websocket will try and connect to /sock
Make sure it is WSS over HTTPS
ex. wss://24.4.237.252/sock

As soon as connection is established send the sock_auth cookie over socket.
This must be the first message sent or else server will close socket.

Play a loading animation over the fields that need to be populated
ex. User picture, user nickname
TBD ^^ (for now just use the ones listed above)

The server will validate the token and send a response.
This will be the first message the client receives from the server.

If there is an error while connecting or a server-side read error,
no messages will be sent and the socket will be closed.

If the token is valid server will send
{"is_valid":"true"}
if not
{"is_valid":"false"}

JSON is of type string:string

If received is_valid == false, display error message (red ! mark would work)
where the loading animation originally played and perform any necessary
onClose actions.

*The server will automatically close the connection if is_valid == false*
**server may close connection at any time due to internal errors, be prepared for this**

Once server gathers user data from steamapi it will send response as follows
{"avatar":URL_TO_AVATAR,"nickname":"7 Day Cooldowns"}

End loading animation and display username and avatar

*make sure sockets do not timeout client-side during operation*
